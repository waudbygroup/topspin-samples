        <h1>The Samples App</h1>

        <p>Type <code>samples</code> in TopSpin to open the GUI. The window navigates to
            your current dataset directory and shows three views: a samples list, a timeline,
            and a catalogue. If the window is already open, typing <code>samples</code>
            brings it to the front.</p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>

        <p>The timeline shows all experiments in chronological order, colour-coded by
            dimensionality (black = 1D, blue = 2D, green = 3D+). Even without sample
            annotations, this gives you a navigable index of your data. Double-click any
            experiment to open that dataset in TopSpin.</p>

        <p>For SampleJet users, holder positions appear automatically in the timeline
            from experiment parameters, without any annotation required.</p>

        <h3>Retrospective Annotation</h3>

        <p>Right-click in the timeline and select the experiments that correspond to a
            single sample. The system sets the created and ejected timestamps from the first
            and last selected experiments. Fill in the form and save — the annotation appears
            as if you'd created it at the time.</p>

        <h2>Catalogue</h2>

        <p>The catalogue shows all samples across your configured root directories, with
            search and filtering. Use it to find samples by user, buffer composition, sample
            components, or any text in the label or notes. Configure root directories via
            Settings to enable multi-directory browsing.</p>

        <!-- catalogue screenshot -->
        <img src="images/sample-catalogue.png" alt="Catalogue view screenshot" class="screenshot">

        <h2>Creating and Editing Samples</h2>

        <p>Click <strong>New...</strong> to create a sample annotation. All fields are
            optional:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>People:</strong> users, research groups</li>
            <li><strong>Sample:</strong> label, components (name, concentration, isotopic labelling)</li>
            <li><strong>Buffer:</strong> pH, solvent, chemical shift reference, buffer components</li>
            <li><strong>NMR Tube:</strong> diameter, type, sample volume, SampleJet position</li>
            <li><strong>Laboratory Reference:</strong> sample ID, lab book entry</li>
            <li><strong>Notes:</strong> free-form text</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- editing screenshot -->
        <img src="images/editing-sample-buffer.png" alt="Sample editing form screenshot" class="screenshot">

        <p>The file is saved as <code>YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_[label].json</code> in the
            experiment directory. Creating a new sample automatically ejects any previously
            active sample — you can only have one sample in the magnet at a time.</p>

        <p>Select a sample and click <strong>Edit</strong> (or double-click) to modify it.
            Click <strong>Duplicate...</strong> to copy it as a template — useful for
            titration series or experiments where only a few parameters change.</p>

        <h2>Ejecting and Deleting</h2>

        <p>Click <strong>Mark as Ejected</strong> to timestamp when a sample was removed.
            Ejected samples can be deleted (this removes the JSON file; experiment data is
            unaffected). Active samples must be ejected before deletion.</p>

        <h2>Schema Versioning</h2>

        <p>New samples use the current schema version. When opening samples created with
            older schema versions, Sample Manager loads the correct historical schema and updates it
            automatically. Saving an old sample upgrades it to the current version. If a
            required schema version isn't installed, update your installation via
            <code>git pull</code>.
